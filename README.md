This is where I started my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub

## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis

RetailTech Insights is an e-commerce analytics firm that partners with Amazon sellers to generate insights for better marketing, product optimization, and customer engagement. As a Junior Data Analyst, I was tasked with exploring customer and product review data to uncover actionable insights.
